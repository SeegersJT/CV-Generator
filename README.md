# CV Generator

This project allows you to generate a personalized CV in PDF format from a JSON file and an HTML template.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cv-generator.git
   cd cv-generator
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Setup

1. **Create your personal `cv_data.json` file**:

   - Copy `src/template/cv_data.example.json` to `src/template/cv_data.json`.
   - Edit `cv_data.json` with your personal information.
   - You can use the structure in the `cv_data.example.json` file as a guide.

2. **Ensure the `cv_data.json` is ignored by Git**:
   - The `.gitignore` file automatically ignores your `cv_data.json` file, so you don't accidentally commit your personal data.

## Usage

1. To generate a PDF of your CV, simply run:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. The PDF will be saved in the `src/downloads` folder, with a filename formatted as:
   ```
   <First Name> <Last Name> CV <YYYY-MM-DD>.pdf
   ```
   If a file with the same name already exists, a number will be appended to the filename (e.g., `CV(1).pdf`, `CV(2).pdf`).

## Example Data Structure
